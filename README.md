# Dynamax
A Website I created for my Microprocessors and Microcontrollers course at VITC. This website manages the user side of a hardware project., and allows the user to check their information and payable amount for their toll road usage.

Dependencies:
1. Streamlit
2. Firebase

Open code in VS Code and type streamlit run main.py in terminal to run
Website should open in default browser
If it throws errors check firebase api key (in account.py)
